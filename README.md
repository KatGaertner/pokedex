# pokedex

This app uses the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a> to fetch a list of Pokemon to browse. Clicking on a Pokemon shows some of its details.

Features now include:
- Responsive layout
- Promises and polyfills
- Finding shiny Pokemon randomly
- Shaky support for swiping between Pokemon in detail view
- Good support for using the arrow keys to do the above

**Gotta fetch them all!**
