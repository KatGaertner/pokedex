# Pokedex

A simple webpage that uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch a list of Pokemon to browse. Clicking on a Pokemon shows some of its details.

The app offers a responsive layout, keyboard accessibility, and lets users search for Pokemon by name. It also uses colored borders to represent a Pokemon's types and includes a feature to randomly find shiny Pokemon sprites for added excitement. The app is designed to be compatible with all modern browsers, as well as Internet Explorer 11.

# Project status

This project was made within the scope of a Web Development course as a portfolio project. As such, it is finished for now.
However I really like this project and in the future I would like to add some features I was missing, like:
- a templating library like Handlebars.js
- caching of the downloaded API data
- lazy loading and infinite scrolling
- utilizing the search more and better
- include more Pokemon data

**Gotta fetch them all!**
